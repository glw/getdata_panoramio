getdata_panoramio
=================

Grab public user data by bounding box.

Takes data from the first 100 users.

The output is not that great still trying to fix that. Im hoping that I can find a solution for a missing compat.py file in the simplejson lib. Is it as simple as jsut adding taht file to the correct directory? I dont know.

Also want to find a way to get around the data request limits.
